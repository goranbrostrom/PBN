# PBN, Portable Bridge Notation

This is a first attempt to create a tool for reading a file in PBN format 
and present the results of a specific team, using **R** and **markdown**.

It is adapted after the PBN files on the home pages of the bridge club 
[BK Björken](http://www.bkbjorken.com) in Umeå, Sweden.

For a description of the PBN format, see
